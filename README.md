﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌﹌<br> **About the Author**<br> My strange little slice of life. I love art, of all kinds. Especially 3D
modeling, graphics, and design. Programs used are Blender, Canva, Godot, Pheonix Code, and VSCode. I get my fonts from
Google Fonts. My jam is interactive projects, where I experiement with layered art to make a digital environment come to
life.
